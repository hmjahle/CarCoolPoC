     * no unallocated tasks the operator return null since it is not possible to change the solution.
     * 3) if it is not possible to remove anything from the solution (the destroy operator fails) and the solution has
     * unallocated tasks, proceed to apply the repair operator to insert original tasks into the that the destroy
     * operator could not destroy.
